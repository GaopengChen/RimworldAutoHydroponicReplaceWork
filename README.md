These are some artworks I created about Floor Hydroponic ideas for Rimworld Mods. 
Anyone can use them for future rimworld Mod development.
Also I upload the PSB file, in case someone want to deep edit those textures, change light colors or what.

In each PSB file, I seperate different layers such as floor, plant, hydroponic board and walls. So it should be easy to edit.
Also you may need to manual switch textures of Open and Close conditions in Photoshop layers, which I also pointed in above IMG.
